* Schoolwork

A repository of the schoolwork I do (digitally) so that it isn't lost
when I change my operating system.

** File Structure

Each large directory indicates the year and the level.

In each large directory, there are sub-directories for each subject taken in that
year.

In each subject directory, each piece of work is labelled with the
date and the name of the assignment (in the format MMDD).
For year-long projects, no date is given.
