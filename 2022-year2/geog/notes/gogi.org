** challenges faced (ageing pop.)
*** impacts
+ inc. resources spent on healthcare
+ inc. strain of working class
  - resources diverted
+ labour $ [shortage of young working pop.]
+ dec. productivity
  - most of the working population old \rightarrow not much work done
+ insufficient young to defend country
***  solutions
**** labour shortage
+ inc. retirement age \rightarrow pop. work for more years
  - possible due to inc. life expectancy
+ draw women back into labour force
  - incentives (home-based, part-time, flexi arrangements, childcare subsidies, exemption for maid levies)

* housing
** impacts of housing shortage
*** lack of safe shelter
+ houses made in /slums/ and /squatter settlements/ have weak foundations
+ unstable walls & roofs made of poor quality materials (e.g. zinc and cardboard)
+ houses collapse easily during natural disasters (floods, earthquakes)
+ construction materials are also flammable \rightarrow inc. risk of fire
+ houses built on unsuitable sites (low-lying areas [flood], steep slopes [landslide])
+ houses built in dense, disorderly manner
	- narrow paths, limited access for vehicles
	- residents may not be able to evacuate quickly, rescue efforts hampered
*** insufficient basic services
+ people lack access to basic services (eg. electricity, clean water, proper sanitation, waste disposal)
+ lack of infrastructure (power lines, water pipes, toilets, waste mgmt. facil.)
+ example: *Nairobi, Kenya*
	- lack of proper sanitation
	- toilet shared by up to 1300 residents
	- access to water is inconsistent
		+ water piped into the slum is often diverted away by indiv. residents / private water companies
	- waste accumulates in streets & rivers
		+ lack of waste disposal facilities
** causes of housing shortage
*** rapid pop. growth
+ /urbanisation/: inc. in proportion of the world's pop. living in cities
	- urban pop. inc.; rural pop. dec.
	- asia & africa projected to exp. the largest inc. in % of pop. in urban areas
+ rapid pop. growth \rightarrow inc. demand for housing
+ inc. in urban pop. \rightarrow further pressure on govt. and devs.
+ rural-urban migration + high birth rates \rightarrow rapid pop. growth
*** migration
**** definitions
+ /migration/: mvmt. of ppl. from one area to another, to take up residence for $\geq$ 1 year
+ /rural-urban migration/: mvmt. of ppl. from rural areas to cities
+ /push factors/: undesirable qualities of the place ppl. leave
	- lack of job opportunities
	- poor edu. facil.
	- lack of healthcare services
	- famine, war
+ /pull factors/: attractive qualities of the place ppl. would like to move to
	- job opportunities
	- better schooling, further edu.
	- more hospitals, doctors
	- perception of exciting city life
	- political stability
**** explanation
+ ppl. move to cities in search of a better life
	- attracted by job opp. in cities
+ more jobs created in cities
	- wider range of econ. activities compared to rural areas
**** example
+ *sao paulo, brazil*
+ migrants
	- there may be insufficient jobs to cater to the huge no. of migrants there
	- migrants may also lack skills req. for jobs avail. in cities
	- \therefore difficulty getting jobs, unable to afford housing
+ city
	- unable to build sufficient houses quickly enough
		+ for housing the huge number of migrants
+ \therefore migrants settle in slums
	- may eventually find employment there (small businesses)
*** high birth rate
**** explanation
+ high rates of nat. inc.
	- high b/r, low d/r
	- cities have a large prop. of ppl. in 20s - 30s; likely to start fam.
	- abv. avg. fertility rates \rightarrow high nat.inc.
+ supply-demand
	- cities have to allocate more resourcees to housing \rightarrow cater to the inc. in pop.
	- \because cities may not be able to build houses fast enough
	- \therefore not every couple may be able to live in formal housing
**** example
+ *london, uk*
+ london's pop. increased (rapidly) by 104 000 in 2012-13
	- high b/r, m/r (migration rates)
	- 86 000 more births than deaths
	- foreign-born mothers accounted for > 1/4 of total births
+ have to allocate more resources to housing to cater to inc. in pop.
*** competing land use
**** explanation
+ many uses for land
	- residential (house)
	- commercial (make $)
	- industrial (factories)
	- recreational (have fun)
	- infrastructure (roads, airports, hospitals)
+ competing uses for land \rightarrow stiff competition \rightarrow insufficient land for housing
	- various grps. of people may have conflict of interest
**** example
+ *Singapore*
+ govt. has committed 17% of land supply to housing to cater to a proj. growth in pop.
+ competing land uses have been identified
	- some golf courses in sg will be removed \rightarrow re-dev. for housing / other
*** limited land supply
+ limited land supply of land suitable for housing
	- physical features (seas, rivers, mts.) limit amt. of land that can be used for housing
	- flat land is preferred for dev.; high $ of construction on steep slopes
+ some cities have small land areas (eg. sg - 716 sq km, hk - 1104 sq km)
	- there is a limit to how much land can be reclaimed from the sea
	- small land area \rightarrow insufficient land for housing
+ high pop. dens. (large pop., limited land area)
	- need to house more ppl. in small area
** consequences of housing shortage
*** homelessness
**** explanation
+ -ve impact on one's health
	- exposure to cold / rain
	- hunger, lack of sleep
	- skin infections, respiratory problems, stress disorders
**** example
+ us dept of housing & urban dev. estimates 610 042 homeless ppl. in the us in a single night (jan 2013)
*** slums & squatter settlements
**** env. pollution
***** explanation
+ inadequate provision of basic svcs. \rightarrow env. pollution
+ *water pollution*
	- rivers near slums may be used for /washing/, /garbage/, and /sewage disposal/.
	- contaminants from sewage can seep into groundwater, pollute nearby water sources (e.g. wells)
+ *land pollution*
	- lack of a garbage disposal system \rightarrow dumping of garbage into open drains
		+ foul smell
		+ eyesore
***** example
+ *Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil*
+ 1970s
	- clear waters, white sandy beaches
	- habitat for diverse range of marine animals
+ present
	- floating rubbish, polluted waters
	- disposal of untreated sewage into the bay (nearby slums, squatter settlements)
**** low level of health, due to poor living conds
***** explanation
+ lack of basic services (clean water, proper sanitation) \rightarrow people more vulnerable to diseases
+ no access to safe drinking water
	- use water from polluted rivers, contaminated wells
	- may have bacteria, causing diseases (eg. cholera)
+ lack of waste mgmt. facil.
	- improper disposal of rubbish
	- stagnant waters (clogged drains, sewers) \rightarrow breeding grounds for mosquitoes \rightarrow malaria, dengue
+ overcrowding
	- large family living in a small room
	- houses closely spaced
	- facil. the rapid spread of diseases
***** example
+ *nairobi, kenya*
+ health of children living in slums is generally poorer than in areas with formal housing
+ d/r of children (<5 y/o) living in slums is 2.5 \times higher than in other parts of the city (who, 2008)
**** vulnerability
***** explanation
+ residents more susceptible to the risk of fires, landslides and evictions (see earlier chapter)
+ slums may be built on land w/o perm. from relevant auth.
	- face the threat of eviction
	- lack a sense of sec. \leftarrow may be forced out of their homes
***** example
1. *mumbai, india*
	 + fire in slum destroys 150 houses
		 - more than 100 1-room shacks, rendered families homeless
		 - cause of fire: short circuit (loose electric wires)
2. *rio de janeiro, brazil*
	 + landslides in a favela in r.d.j. \rightarrow 256 ppl. killed (apr 2010)
	 + occurred after a period of heavy rain, a house collapsed down a hill
3. *dhaka, bangladesh*
	 + court order to clear the land issued \rightarrow 40 000 people evicted from korail slum (2012)
	 + social tension between auth. & residents
		 - residents staged protest \rightarrow govt. promised to stop temp. evicting residents
** strategies to manage housing
*** slum upgrading
**** explanation
+ cities improve the quality of housing & basic svcs.
+ slum sites cleared and basic infrastructure provided (the whole house)
+ residents move out and relocate
+ financial schemes & assistance provided
**** advantages
+ residents can be provided with housing relatively quickly with all svcs. covered
**** disadvantages
+ high costs for the govt.
+ some residents may face difficulties paying for the cost
+ residents reluctant to move and be left without a house temp.
**** example
+ *nairobi, kenya*
+ govt. partnered with the un (un-habitat) in a proj. which aims to provide residents with the rights to build on the existing land & improve housing conds. and infra-str.
+ residents shift temporarily to an area with new housing units (equipped with svcs.)
+ vacated slum area upgraded & residents can return to the original sites once complete
*** self-help schemes
**** explanation
+ low income households to improve the cond. of existing housing
+ govt.s do not provide housing directly
	- provide assistance in other forms:
		+ construction materials
		+ basic svcs.
+ ppl. build the houses themselves
	- at their own pace / in free time (after work / weekends)
	- training provided by govt.
**** advantages
+ reduced construction costs
**** disadvantages
+ training needs to be provided
	- even then, still has chance of being dangerous
+ the pace of construction is slow due to schedule clashes etc.
**** example
+ *rocinha project, brazil*
+ most wooden houses replaced by concrete houses
+ 75% of homes have electricity (compared to 30% in the past)
+ rooftop water tanks, piped water systems
+ sanitation facilities (eg. toilets, sewers)
*** public housing
**** explanation
+ govt. efforts to provide housing units with basic svcs.
	- usu. for low-income hh. + other persons of need (elderly, disabled)
+ reasonably priced (compared to private housing)
	- subsidised by govt.
+ other methods of public housing
	- old flats may be rented at a low price
	- abandoned buildings converted for residential use
	- new apartments built
**** advantages
+ low cost (for both govt. and people)
**** disadvantages
+ may be difficult to roll out in a larger country due to the sheer number of residents such a scheme would have to cater to (diff. local issues to be managed)
**** example
1. *singapore*
	 + 1960-70s: slums / squatter settlements had to be cleared \rightarrow provide higher quality housing to residents
		 - hdb (housing dev. board) set up (1960) \rightarrow build and provide public housing for sg's inc. pop.
	 + public housing programmes achieved success
		 - address the diverse needs of all residents
		 - > 80% of sg's pop. lives in hdb flats (2013)
2. *r.d.j., brazil*
	 + bairro carioca project
		 - comprises 2240 apartments which will house 10k people
		 - govt. partnership with private sector
			 + companies hired to build basic infrastructure of roads, sewerage & water; design and build housing units
*** provision of inclusive housing (sg)
**** definition
+ a city which provides all residents with adequate housing & access to all basic svcs. (tpt., rec.)
+ all residents feel a sense of belonging and actively contribute to the community
**** affordable housing
***** definition
+ housing that is priced at a reasonable cost such that residents still have enough money for other basic needs
***** how?
+ variety of housing types to cater to the diff. income grps.
	- private property / condominiums (high-income pop.)
	- public housing (low-income pop.)
+ types of public housing increased to meet residents' needs
	- studio apartments \rightarrow seniors
	- 3-room flats \rightarrow smaller families
***** examples
1. financial schemes
	 + subsidise the cost of flats
	 + additional cpf housing grant (ahg) (2006)
		 - helps low-income fam. buy their first flat
		 - families earning not more than S$5000 / month can qualify for a grant of up to S$40000, used to pay for flat
2. ethnic integration
	 + ethnic integ. policy (eip) (1989)
	 + promote racial integ. and harmony
		 - includes ppl. of diff. races in the nbh. by specifying ethnic quotae for each block
	 + creates opp. for interaction among residents from diverse bgs.
**** facilites & amenities for all ages
***** how?
+ impt. to provide range of facils. and amenities for diff. age grps.
+ retail shops, clinics, parks are common in nbhs.
***** example
1. 3-generation (3g) facilities
	 + playground, adult fitness corner, wellness stations (seniors)
	 + cater to the needs of multi generational fam.
2. seniors activity centres (sac)
	 + set up near hdb rental / studio apt. blocks (where the elderly usu. live)
	 + snrs. encouraged to spend time @ centres \rightarrow interact & exercise with others
3. gen. infrastructure
	 + corridors in residential dev.: min. width. - 1.5 m
		 - facil. access for ppl. using mobility aids (eg. wheelchairs)
**** strong sense of place & belonging
***** definition
+ sense of place = meaning and value people attach to a place as a res. of their exp. / unique. chars. of a place
***** why?
+ ppl. may regard places w. special meaning & rmb. these places fondly
+ spent much time there / had +ve exp.
+ more likely to dev. a sense of place & belonging
***** how?
+ distinctive phys. features \rightarrow give the place its visual quality, char. and identity
	- monuments
	- gardens
+ allows ppl to recog. and recall a place easily \rightarrow contrib. to sense of place & belonging
***** example
+ rounded balconise & spiral staircases of hdb flats (tiong bahru)
	- unique phys. feature \rightarrow may evoke a sense of place & belonging for tiong bahru residents
** end remarks
housing is an important basic need which impacts one's q.o.l.
with the rise in urban pop., cities face inc. pressure to provide sufficient housing.
the nature & extent of housing shortage varies between cities. thus, they have adopted diff. strategies to manage the issue of housing shortage.

although sg has achieved considerable success in providing quality housing, it needs to continue to be responsive to the changing needs & aspirations of its people.
as sg begins to exp. an ageing pop., facil. and amenities which provide care & support svcs. for the elderly would become inc. impt.
